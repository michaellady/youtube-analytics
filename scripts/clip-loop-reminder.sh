# Daily reminder to run the FULL cross-platform clip closed loop INTERACTIVELY.
#
# Why this only reminds (doesn't measure): the cross-platform half of the loop
# (Facebook / Instagram / TikTok / LinkedIn) must read each platform's native
# analytics through a logged-in browser via claude-in-chrome — which cannot run
# headless/unattended (cf. the studio-watch routine, blocked since 2026-05-18).
# So this job just pings you; you run `/clip-results` with Claude while at the
# machine, and Claude drives the browser sweep + the Go aggregator.
#
# Fires daily at 9:30 AM local via
#   ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.mikelady.yt-clip-loop-reminder.plist
#   (install: make clip-loop-reminder-install)
# Uninstall once the ~2-3 week measurement window closes:
#   make clip-loop-reminder-uninstall
