Analytics window for `fetch-analytics` is fixed at 2025-12-01 → today in `fetch_analytics.go`. Change that file if you need a different baseline.

### fetch-analytics dimensional flags

The base `fetch-analytics` only pulls aggregate-over-window metrics. The flags below add additive dimensional data — aggregate fields stay populated, the new fields just go alongside them:

| Flag | Adds to each video | Useful for |
|------|---------------------|------------|
| `--daily` | `daily_metrics[]` — date, views, watch_min, retention, subs | Date-correlation hypotheses ("did newsletter mention spike views on 2026-04-23?") |
| `--traffic-sources` | `traffic_sources{}` — keyed by `YT_SEARCH`, `RELATED_VIDEO`, `SUBSCRIBER`, `EXT_URL`, `BROWSE`, `NOTIFICATION`, etc. | "Did the format-fatigue collapse come from SUBSCRIBER traffic drying up, or RELATED_VIDEO suppression?" |
| `--sub-status` | `sub_status_metrics{SUBSCRIBED, UNSUBSCRIBED}` | Cleaner conversion signal — `subs/1K` over `UNSUBSCRIBED.views` is the actual conversion target |
| `--all` | All three at once | Default for closed-loop weekly review |

Each flag adds one extra batched API call per fetch. Daily uses a smaller batch size (50 vs 200) because rows-per-video balloon with the day dimension.

### fetch-comments

`fetch-comments` writes top-level comments for filtered videos to `data/comments.json`, keyed by video ID. Re-running merges by ID — videos NOT in the current run keep their previously-fetched comments.

```bash
# All videos (uses the full filter set — flags must precede positional)
go run . fetch-comments --limit 20

# Just past-week long-forms in a cohort
go run . fetch-comments --since 2026-04-19 --type long-form --cohort gastown-series --limit 10

# Time-ordered (most recent first) instead of relevance
go run . fetch-comments --order time --limit 5
```

Comments are qualitative signal. Use them when grading hypotheses: read the model the top-3 comments per cited video and let it spot themes (confusion, requests, push-back). Don't try to classify sentiment in Go — that's cognition, belongs in the prompt.

## Filter Flags

**Available on `analyze`, `dashboard`, `find-duplicates`, `data-quality`, `titles`, `export`:**

| Flag | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `--since YYYY-MM-DD` | Published on/after |
| `--until YYYY-MM-DD` | Published on/before |
| `--type <short\|long-form\|live>` | Video type (repeatable) |
| `--duration-min N` / `--duration-max N` | Duration bounds in seconds |
| `--exclude <ID>` | Skip specific video (repeatable) |
| `--cohort <id>` | Filter to a cohort id from `data/cohorts.yaml` (repeatable) |

> **Go stdlib flag note:** when a command takes both filter flags and a positional argument (e.g. `cohort show <id>`, `insights grade <id>`, `video <id>`), the flags must come *before* the positional. `cohort show --since 2026-04-19 gastown-series` works; `cohort show gastown-series --since 2026-04-19` silently ignores the `--since` flag.

## Typical Workflows

**Full refresh + report** ("fetch latest", "run analytics again", "since we last ran it"):
```bash
cd /Users/mikelady/dev/youtube_analytics
go run . fetch
go run . fetch-analytics --all   # aggregate + per-day + traffic-sources + sub-status
go run . cohort auto             # refresh cohort assignments from rules
go run . analyze > data/analytics_report.md
```

**Report only** (cached data): `go run . analyze`

**Dashboard**: `go run . dashboard` (add filter flags for a scoped view)

## Sister skills

When a NEW video drops:
- **`/yt-launch <id>`** — sets up monitoring (cohort + hypothesis + daily LaunchAgent). Run this first.
- **`/yt-ab <id>`** — A/B tests title via YouTube Studio's native Test and Compare. Run after `/yt-launch`. Drives Studio in your logged-in Chrome via `mcp__claude-in-chrome`.

These are user-invocable slash commands that orchestrate this skill's primitives plus browser automation. Mention them when the user asks "should I track this launch?" or "how do I A/B test this title?".

## Closed-Loop Weekly Review (cohorts + hypotheses)

The weekly review is a **skill workflow**, not a single command. The CLI handles transport (data, file IO, deterministic rules); the model handles cognition (grading, hypothesis generation). This split is deliberate — see `docs/primitive-test.md`.

Cohorts are named groups of videos defined in `data/cohorts.yaml` with optional auto-match rules (regex on title/description, video_type, duration, publish date). Run `go run . cohort auto` to (re)derive assignments after `fetch`. Manual-only cohorts (no rules) are managed via `cohort assign/unassign`.

Insights live in `data/insights/<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` with YAML frontmatter:
```yaml
---
date: 2026-04-26
hypotheses:
  - id: h-2026-04-26-1
    cohort: gastown-series
    prediction: Title variation will lift retention on next 3 long-forms
    evidence_video_ids: [abc, def, ghi]
    metric: retention
    direction: up
    evaluate_after: 2026-05-10
    outcome: ""
    verdict: ""
---
```

### Weekly review workflow

1. **Refresh data** (transport):
   ```bash
   go run . fetch && go run . fetch-analytics --all
   go run . cohort auto
   # Optional: fetch fresh comments for any cohort under active hypothesis
   go run . fetch-comments --since <last-monday> --limit 10
   ```
   Use `--all` so `insights pending` can surface the per-day trajectory, traffic sources, and sub-status split for cited videos — without those dimensions you're stuck with the same aggregate the prior cycle had.

2. **Pull the numbers the model needs** (transport):
   ```bash
   go run . analyze --compare-periods <prev-week> <this-week>
   go run . cohort report --since <last-monday>
   go run . insights pending          # past-due hypotheses + current metrics
   ```

3. **GRADE pending hypotheses** (cognition — model judgment, NOT Go):
   For each hypothesis emitted by `insights pending`:
   - Read its prediction + the cited videos' current metrics (already in the output)
   - Decide verdict: `confirm` / `refute` / `inconclusive` — explain reasoning
   - Persist (flags must precede the hypothesis-id positional argument):
     ```bash
     go run . insights grade --verdict <v> --outcome "<what actually happened>" <id>
     ```

4. **Report to the user** with:
   - Cohort movement first (lead here, not raw totals)
   - WoW deltas
   - Verdicts on hypotheses graded this cycle
   - 1-3 NEW hypotheses for next week

5. **Persist the new hypotheses** (cognition writing transport-readable files):
   ```bash
   go run . insights new <this-monday>     # creates the file
   ```
   Then edit the file directly to add hypothesis entries with frontmatter (id, cohort, prediction, evidence_video_ids, metric, direction, evaluate_after).

### Why this isn't a single `review` command

Mechanical "did metric X move by N?" grading and auto-generated hypothesis stubs would fail the Bitter Lesson — a smarter model produces better verdicts and better hypotheses from the prompt than from a hardcoded comparator. Go shuttles the data; the model brings the judgment.

## "Since we last ran it" Pattern

`fetch` auto-snapshots to `data/snapshots/videos-<UTC timestamp>.json` and keeps the last 30.

To answer "what changed since last run":
```bash
# Most recent snapshot
ls -t data/snapshots/videos-*.json | head -1

# Delta since then
go run . analyze --diff data/snapshots/videos-<timestamp>.json
```

The snapshots directory is the history — no manual bookkeeping needed.

## OAuth

`fetch-analytics` uses OAuth2. Token cached at `data/token.json`. Expired token → browser opens on `localhost:8089/callback`. Scopes: `yt-analytics.readonly` + `yt-analytics-monetary.readonly`.

## Data Schema (`data/videos.json`)

`ChannelData` has `channel_id`, `channel_title`, `fetched_at`, `has_analytics`, `analytics_fetched_at`, `videos[]`. Each video:

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | YouTube video ID |
| `title`, `description`, `tags` | string/[]string | `tags` often null |
| `published_at` | RFC3339 string | |
| `duration_seconds` | int | short: ≤60, long-form: >60 non-live, live: hasLiveBroadcast |
| `video_type` | string | `"short"` \| `"long-form"` \| `"live"` |
| `view_count`, `like_count`, `comment_count` | int | |
| `estimated_minutes_watched` | float | requires `fetch-analytics` |
| `average_view_duration` | float (seconds) | |
| `average_view_percentage` | float (0-100) | retention |
| `subscribers_gained`, `subscribers_lost` | int | |
| `estimated_revenue` | float (USD) | monetization scope |
| `cpm`, `ad_impressions`, `monetized_playbacks` | | |

## Common Recipes

**Recent 3-10 min long-form performance:**
```bash
go run . analyze --since 2026-04-01 --type long-form --duration-min 180 --duration-max 600
```

**Best live-stream titles:**
```bash
go run . titles --top 10 --by views --type live
# Or by conversion: --by subs / --by retention / --by revenue
```

**Data quality audit on a slice:**
```bash
go run . data-quality --since 2026-04-01 --type long-form
```

**Compare two months side-by-side:**
```bash
go run . analyze --compare-periods 2026-01-01..2026-01-31 2026-03-01..2026-03-31
```

**CSV export for spreadsheet work:**
```bash
go run . export --format csv --since 2026-04-01 --output recent.csv
```

**One-video deep-dive:**
```bash
go run . video Rn0Oc9U0AOE
```

**Did newsletter mention drive views on a specific day?** (requires `fetch-analytics --daily` first):
```bash
# Filter daily_metrics[] for the newsletter send date
jq '.videos[] | select(.video_type=="long-form") | {id, title, day: (.daily_metrics[]? | select(.date == "2026-04-23"))}' data/videos.json | head -40
```

**Conversion target only (UNSUBSCRIBED viewers):** subs/1K is contaminated by SUBSCRIBED viewers who can't sub again. After `fetch-analytics --sub-status`:
```bash
jq -r '.videos[] | select(.sub_status_metrics.UNSUBSCRIBED.views > 100) | [
  ((.subscribers_gained // 0) / .sub_status_metrics.UNSUBSCRIBED.views * 1000),
  .sub_status_metrics.UNSUBSCRIBED.views,
  .title
] | @tsv' data/videos.json | sort -rn | head -10
```

**Where did views come from?** (after `fetch-analytics --traffic-sources`):
```bash
go run . video <id>     # video deep-dive doesn't yet surface traffic sources, so:
jq '.videos[] | select(.id=="<video-id>") | .traffic_sources' data/videos.json
```

## Escape Hatch: jq on `data/videos.json`

For one-off slices the CLI doesn't cover, jq still works:

```bash
# Aggregate over a filtered slice
jq '[.videos[] | select(.published_at >= "2026-04-01" and .video_type == "long-form")] | {count: length, avg_views: (map(.view_count) | add/length)}' data/videos.json

# Subs per 1K views ranking
jq -r '.videos[] | select(.video_type == "live" and .view_count >= 100) | [((.subscribers_gained // 0) / .view_count * 1000), .title] | @tsv' data/videos.json | sort -rn | head -10
```

Prefer the CLI when it fits — jq is for novel questions.

## Analysis Playbook

Match the user's request to the command:

| User asks | Command |
|---|---|
| "best/top titles for X" | `titles --top 10 --by views --type <X>` |
| "analyze recent [type]" | `analyze --since <date> --type <type>` |
| "since last run" | `analyze --diff <latest snapshot>` |
| "what's hurting the channel" | `data-quality` + look for low-retention+high-views in `analyze` |
| "duplicate check" | `find-duplicates` |
| "which format works" | `analyze` (look at subs/1K views by type) |
| "compare X period to Y" | `analyze --compare-periods A..B C..D` |
| "how is the X cohort doing" | `cohort report` or `analyze --cohort X` |
| "weekly review" / "closed loop" | run the Closed-Loop Weekly Review workflow above |
| "what did we predict last week" | `insights pending` then grade verdicts |
| "tell me about this video" | `video <id>` |
| "dump to spreadsheet" | `export --format csv --output path.csv` |

## Reporting Conventions

When presenting analytics to the user:
- **Lead with cohort movement** when cohorts are defined — that's the unit of intentional decision-making, not raw channel totals
- **Lead with the delta** if comparing to a previous run (new videos, new subs, new revenue)
- **Subs per 1K views** is the cleanest conversion metric — live streams dominate (~17) vs shorts (~0.7)
- **Retention + views together** — high views with low retention is a red flag, not a win
- **Flag data-quality issues proactively** (null tags, templated descriptions, duplicate uploads)
- **Don't rank by views alone** when the user is deciding what content to make — weight by subs gained and retention
- **Hypothesis grading is your judgment** — `insights pending` gives you the numbers; you give the verdict

## Common Pitfalls

- **`average_view_percentage` >100%** is possible on very short videos (rewatches). Always pair with view count and duration.
- **`video_type` classification happens at fetch time** — shorts are `duration_seconds ≤ 60`; re-run `fetch` if boundaries seem wrong.
- **OAuth token at `data/token.json`** is personal; never commit.
- **Analytics are aggregate-only** — the CLI doesn't do per-day breakdowns.
- **`--until` is inclusive** — the whole final day is included (rolls to 23:59:59).
